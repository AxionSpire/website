# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is mainly intended for our servers, only the latest version is supported by us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities via email to [security@axionspire.net](mailto:security@axionspire.net).
Include as detailed of a report as possible.
We will reward researchers in a way outlined in our OSS Contributor Rewards, possibly extending to money (though likely it will be in-game rewards, as this is a hobby project).
